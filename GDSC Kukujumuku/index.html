  <p>This is the curriculum for the first session that is part of the "kukujumuku" peer learning event that <a href="https://gdsc.community.dev/wartburg-college/" class="inner-logo">WARTBURG GDSC</a>
      will be initiating this year. In this session student will be introduced to the c# programming language.
      The prerequisite for this session is an introduction to programming using the python programming language. It is
      exciting because once you already know one programming language it is fairly easy to learn a new language. In this course
      all of the coding examples will be done in both python and c#. The main goal is to allow python developers to transfer
      most of the programming concepts they learned in python over to c#. More time will be spent on explaining the difference in the syntax between
      the two languages. The expectation of this session is not to become an expert in C# but to understand the basic of the language.

    <p>I am passionate about learning new tools and technologies. Apart
      from coding I spent my free time watching football/soccer games and sometime playing with friends. I have interest
      in learning good software engineering principles, and computer graphics. I love to learn new programming language. Sometime
      in the future I will like  to develop applications that includes machine learning algorithm. I developed this mini course
      with python developers in mind. It is definitely a good thing to have more than one language as part of your toolset. Apart from c# and python
      I have also been coding heavily in javascript recently and a little bit of java.
