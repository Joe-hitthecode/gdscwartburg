     that is written in a class. Functions that are created in a  specific class are called  methods in object oriented programming. The syntax
     for writting function is different in the two language. Python is a flexible and less syntax heavy. The underlying concept remain the same.
     There are functions or methods that return value to the caller and also functions that don't.
